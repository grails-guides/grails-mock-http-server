The first step is to add the Micronaut HTTP client library to our project. Add the next dependency:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/build.gradle[tag=micronaut-http-client]
----

If you are a windows user you need to have this in `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
webdriverBinaries {
    chromedriver {
        version = '77.0.3865.40'
        architecture = 'X86'
    }
    geckodriver '0.24.0'
}
----
